The if and else Statements
With a grasp on comparisons, we can now look at how to use conditionals to run different pieces of logic based on values. The main keywords for conditionals in Python are if and else. Conditionals are the first language feature we're using that require us to utilize whitespace to separate our code blocks. We will always use 4 spaces as indentation. The basic shape of an if statement is this:

if CONDITION:
    print("CONDITION was True")
The CONDITION portion can be anything that evaluates to True or False, and if the value isn't explicitly a boolean then it will be implicitly converted to determine how to proceed past the conditional (essentially wrapping the CONDITION with the bool constructor):

>>> if True:
...     print("Was True")
...
Was True
>>> if False:
...     print("Was True")
...
>>>
To add an alternative code path, we'll use the else keyword, followed by a colon (:), and indent the code underneath:

>>> if False:
...     print("Was True")
... else:
...     print("Was False")
...
Was False
